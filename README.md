This pack is designed to transform Windows 10 into a mini-clone of Windows XP. To install it correctly, please follow the instructions in the README — and seriously, make sure you actually read it. This pack does not aim to be a 100% replica of Windows XP. Before doing anything, create a System Restore Point; this doesn't mean there's a high risk of breaking your system, it's just a precaution. Enjoy and good luck!
